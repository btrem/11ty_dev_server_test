title: “Return of Django” by The Upsetters
---

Early in Lee Perry's career as an independent producer,
he recorded a slew of instrumentals credited to his
house band, The Upsetters.
For song titles, Perry took inspiration from
[Spaghetti Westerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_Western).
Like many reggae artists, he loved that film genre.
A quick glance at his output includes

- “High Plains Drifter”
- “Dig Your Grave”
- “Big John Wayne”
- “The Man With No Name”
- “Amigo”

Let's add to that list “Return of Django,” my favorite of
the late 60s/early 70s Perry instrumentals.
<!-- excerpt -->
The recording features tenor saxophonist Val Bennett
in one of his finest efforts.


“Return of Django” was especially popular in the U.K.,
where it was a top-ten hit for over a month in November, 1969.
Unfortunately, most record buyers had no idea who played the
scorching sax because Bennett's name didn't appear on the label.
The omission was probably not deliberate.
After all, Perry did credit him on other records from this
period, e.g., “Stranger on the Shore,” “Val Blows In,”
and the aforementioned “Big John Wayne.”
But what a shame that one of his biggest hits failed to name
the veteran musician.


## “Sick and Tired”



In 1973, Perry produced singer Neville Grant covering
“Sick and Tired”
(written by New Orleans rhythm and blues artist Chris Kenner,
based on an earlier tune called “Oh Red”).
For this cover version, Perry fit the lyrics of
“Sick and Tired” over the “Return of Django” rhythm,
saxophone solo and all.





## Release Notes
