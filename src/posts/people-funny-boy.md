title: “People Funny Boy”
subtitle: Lee “Scratch” Perry's First Self-Financed Production and Its Many Variations

---

In 1968, reggae pioneer Lee “Scratch” Perry launched his first
record label, Upset Records, with the single “People Funny Boy.”
The title might seem odd, but try this: mentally insert a comma
so that it reads “People Funny, Boy.” It's a complaint, as in
“boy, people are funny.”

That raises the question: who was Perry complaining about?
Who was acting “funny?”

The answer: his former employer, Joel Gibson,
<abbr title="also known as">AKA</abbr> Joe Gibbs.


## Working for Joe Gibbs

Two years earlier, Perry had begun working for Gibbs,
ostensibly a music producer.
In reality, Gibbs was not a music producer, but an executive producer —
he financed the operation.
*Perry* was the music producer. He scouted talent, supervised
sessions, arranged and wrote songs, and promoted records that
appeared on Gibbs' Amalgamated and Pressure Beat labels.

In this role, Perry produced — and probably wrote — “Long Shot,” with
the Pioneers providing vocals.
The song tells the tale of a man who loses money betting on a long
shot horse:

> Why? Why? Long shot bust me bet
> Him gallup, him gallup, him gallup
> But him couldn't bust the tape
> Him gallup, him gallup, him gallup
> But him couldn't bust the tape
> Man tis lick him, him whip him, him lash him
> But him couldn't bust the tape {.lyrics}

And now the hapless man must go home, where there's sure to
be an argument over his foolish bet:

> Why? Why? Chugga chugga war a yard
> Why? Why? Oh me a go home tonight {.lyrics}

It was a hit, one of many that Perry provided for Gibbs.
And yet, despite the success, he didn't feel he was receiving
the credit and compensation he deserved.
Thus, only a few months after producing “Long Shot,” he quit.


## Perry Records His Revenge

Perry financed his next record, with himself as vocalist,
for a cut titled “People Funny Boy.” And rather than give
it to another producer, he launched a new label, Upset
Records.

“People Funny Boy” is essentially a reworking of “Long Shot”
with different lyrics.
Instead of lamenting a loss at the race track, the updated song
laments the greed of his former employer:

> Now that you reach the top
> And you turn big shot
> All I've done for you
> You no remember that
> When you were down and out
> I use to help you out
> But now that you hit jackpot
> You no remember that
> Now that you turn big shot
> Boy you have big chat
>
> You lucky, you lucky, you lucky, you lucky
> To have rice and peas a yard
> But me, poor me don't have none at all
> A what a, a what a, a what a, a what a, a what a oomph! a ya tonight {.lyrics .peopleFunnyBoy}


Some lines are new, others are clearly adapted from the earlier Pioneers' record:


Perry based not just the lyrics but also the music on his previous hit.
The bass and, in particular, the rhythm guitar of “People Funny Boy”
closely match the bass and piano of “Long Shot.”



“People Funny Boy” is celebrated as one of the first, maybe
*the* first, reggae records.
For what it's worth, I'm not so sure.
Admittedly, I have no musical training, so discussion of
notes and beats is more often than not lost on me.
That said, I think the almost doubled piano rhythm of
“Long Shot” strongly suggests the emerging reggae style,
and distinguishes it from the simpler bass and guitar patterns
of rock steady.


### Sound Effects

If “People Funny Boy” wasn't the first reggae record, it
was *one* of the first.
It was also one of the first to use sound effects.
There's a baby crying — wailing, really — throughout the record.

Why a baby crying? Is it supposed to be mocking Gibbs?
Perry is the one complaining, so maybe it represents him?
It's hard to say, but it works aesthetically.
And that would become a trend for Perry.
In the next decade, he often used sound effects that on
paper seem odd but on vinyl come off really well.


## Joe Gibbs' Retort (Such As It Is)


Gibbs didn't appreciate getting badmouthed that way, so he
decided to respond on vinyl with “People Grudgeful.”
The Ethiopians provided the vocals, but the label doesn't
mention them, crediting instead Sir Gibbs as the artist.
It was, after all, important that the record buying public
know who was doing the trash talking.




Like many an answer record, “People Grudgeful” takes
the music from the song it is responding to, changing
only the lyrics:

> Why? Why, people grudgeful boy
> When I was down and out
> You didn't help me out
> Now that I win jackpot
> You want to talk about
> Now that I turn big shot
> You start to chat
> You can walk and talk
> Walk and talk
> But me no care at all {.lyrics}

Well, Sir Gibbs, you recorded an answer record, so
apparently you *do* care.

Unfortunately for Gibbs, his effort is derivative and uninspired.
The music is a copy of Perry's stylistic changes, notably
the scratchy guitar.
But it's overdone to the point that it grates on the ear.
And the lyrics just naysay Perry's accusations. For example,
<q>when you were down and out, I use to help you out</q>
becomes
<q>when I was down and out, you didn't help me out.</q>
Forgive my being harsh, but that's about the level of
a grade school taunt.


## The Pioneers' Sequel


Let's return for a moment to the song that began this dispute.
Apparently, the steed in “Long Shot” was a real race horse who
died in 1969, a year after Perry and Gibbs traded barbs.
An entirely different producer, Leslie Kong, decided to
capitalize on the poor creature's misfortune. He produced
a sequel, “Long Shot Kick the Bucket,” voiced once again
by The Pioneers.
As before, the better loses his money, this time because
the horse he bets on dies during the race:

> It was [?], Combat, Carousel
> Long Shot on the rail
> Combat fell
> Long Shot fell
> All me money gone a hell
> All me money gone a hell
> Long Shot him kick the bucket
> Long Shot kick the bucket {.lyrics}



Though to my ears the earlier record is both musically superior
and more entertaining, the sequel proved to be the bigger hit,
especially in the <abbr title="United Kingdom">U.K.</abbr>
where it was a favorite among
[skinheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinhead).
A decade later, second wave ska band The Special AKA
covered the song for the live
<abbr title="extended play record">EP</abbr>
<cite>Too Much Too Young</cite>.
That prompted a reissue of The Pioneers'
“Long Shot Kick the Bucket,” which cracked the British
charts a second time.

#### The Fall, “Why Are People Grudgeful?”

I learned about this song from a colleague during my
days at community radio station
[WMUA](https://www.umass.edu/wmua/),
but I don't own a copy myself.
However, the interwebs informs
me that it was issued as a 12-inch single on Permanent Records.
