[NPR](https://www.npr.org/)'s
afternoon news program
[All Things Considered](https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/)
aired a remembrance of
Neville Livingston, known to reggae fans as
Bunny Wailer,
who passed away
<time datetime="2021-03-02">
  this week.
</time>

Bunny was one of the founding members of
[The Wailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley_and_the_Wailers),
whence came his adopted last name.
He wasn't as well known as his bandmates
Bob Marley and Peter Tosh, but NPR nevertheless felt he
deserved recognition for his contributions to the group.
Yet the piece largely passed over those contributions,
making it seem like he was only a backup singer until he
went solo.

That is a misconception that I'd like to correct.

<!-- excerpt -->



The NPR piece,
“<cite class="p-name"><a class="u-url" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/02/972832265/">Bunny
Wailer, Iconic Reggae Singer And Wailers Co-Founder, Has Died At Age 73</a>,</cite>”
aired on
<time class="dt-published" datetime="2021-03-02">
  March 2<span class="sameYear">, 2021</span>,
  the day he passed away.
</time>
<time class="dt-accessed" datetime="2021-03-02"></time>
The reporter was
[Anastasia Tsioulcas](https://www.npr.org/people/182335974/anastasia-tsioulcas),
who also did a
[piece on U-Roy's passing a week earlier](/2021/02-u-roy-obit).
So apparently she's on NPR's reggae beat, if you'll pardon the pun.{.u-in-reply-to .h-cite}

The first half of the piece looks at Bunny's early years
in the music business, and includes two poorly chosen Wailers'
songs, "Simmer Down" and "Stir It Up." There's nothing
wrong with those songs per se. It's just that they're sung
by Bob Marley, not Bunny, the ostensible subject of the
story. Tsioulcas then pivots to his solo career, noting
that Bunny "was recording singles in his own right" when
he left the band in 1974.

Well, yes, but he also sang lead on some killer records
*before* going solo. When she was recapping his early
career, couldn't she have chosen Wailers' records where
he played a more prominent role?
Like "Let Him Go" instead of "Simmer Down." Both tunes were
recorded at the legendary Studio One. Both were popular
enough in Jamaica to warrant a U.K. release. But
only one, "Let Him Go," featured Bunny on lead.

And check out the lyrics regarding the plight of Kingston's
disaffected youths, known as <dfn>rudies</dfn>, about the
discrimination they faced and their mistreatment by
Jamaica's criminal justice system:



> You frame him yourself
> Things he didn't do
> You rebuke and you scorn
> And you make him feel blue
> Let him go! {.lyrics}

In today's world of protests against racism and police abuse,
those lyrics are strikingly relevant.
Which makes it all the more maddening that NPR took a pass
on one of Bunny's early compositions.

Another odd omission is the Wailers' 1971 recording of
"Dreamland." The piece instead uses a 1976 rerecording that
Bunny cut as a solo artist. Now if it were me, I'd have gone
with the 1971 version. Why? Because it's an example of Bunny
singing lead while he was still with the Wailers; because it
was big enough to spawn several versions (e.g., a deejay outing
by U-Roy, an organ version released on the Upsetters
<abbr title="long player">LP</abbr>
<cite>Africa's Blood</cite>, and a dub remix on the
legendary <cite>Blackboard Jungle Dub</cite> LP); and,
finally, because "Dreamland" became almost a signature song
on account of that 1971 recording.

If NPR was committed to the later version of "Dreamland,"
there are other Wailers' records they could have chosen
that, again, feature Bunny *on lead*. Like, say,
"Brainwashing," a searing critique of Jamaica's
educational system "coming through on a poor man's
child." Or perhaps "Pass It On" or "Hallelujah Time," both
recorded for the <cite>Burnin'</cite>
<abbr title="long player">LP</abbr>.

As with Tsioulcas'
[U-Roy remembrance](/2021/02-u-roy-obit),
I get the sense that she doesn't know the genre very
well. But surely *someone* at NPR is aware of
<cite>Burnin'</cite>. It was released internationally on
Island Records, which means you can find it in any decent
record store. Or just
[look it up on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnin'_(The_Wailers_album)){title="Wikipedia article on the Wailers' 'Burnin' album"},
for crying out loud.

I'll admit that I probably sound like a broken record.
(Sorry for the pun; that's twice in one article.)
I'm happy &mdash; as I was when NPR aired two U-Roy
obituaries &mdash; to see NPR turn our attention to reggae
artists who are not exactly household names in the
U.S. But as with the
[U-Roy obituaries](/2021/02-u-roy-obit),
I wish someone who had more than a passing familiarity
with reggae would step up and provide better editing.
