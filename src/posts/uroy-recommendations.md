A couple of days ago, I chided
[NPR](https://www.npr.org/)'s
“[Here and Now](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow)”
program for choosing a less-than-stellar record to
excerpt in their
[U-Roy obituary](/2021/02-u-roy-obit).
After hearing the piece, I compiled a short list
of U-Roy recordings from my collection that,
in my humble opionion, would have been better
examples of his work. And
certainly worth listening to even if you're not
producing an on-air tribute to the deejay
<i>originator</i>.


<!-- excerpt -->

“Wake the Town”
: This is one of the trio of singles that launched U-Roy's
career (the others are “Rule the Nation” and “Wear You to
the Ball”). U-Roy's introduces the record thus:
<span class="lyrics">
“Wake the town and tell the people
about this musical disc coming your way!”
</span>
Which is how he might have introduced it live at
a sound system performance, telling the crowd
what's coming next. But here, the introduction *is*
the what's coming next because it's the name of the
disc. The artform is nothing if not self-aware.
The rhythm is a version mix of Alton Ellis'
“Girl I've Got a Date.”

“The Hudson Affair”
: No need for a dub mix. The backing track is the standard
a-side mix of the intrumental “Riot.”
Players of instruments are the Soul Syndicate,
producer is Keith Hudson.

“Number One In the World”
: U-Roy delivers a great boast over a killer rhythm from
producer Glen Brown. The reverb-drenched drum-only
introduction is alone worth the price of admission.



“King Tubby's Special”
: A tribute to King Tubby, whose innovative
dub mixes helped lauch U-Roy's recording career.
The producer is Bunny Lee, the rhythm a synthesizer
version of Gregory Isaacs' “Don't Believe In Him,”
itself a cover of Delano Stewart. There's a different
cut on this rhythm by U-Roy, with different lyrics and
no synth, titled “King Tubby's Skank.”

“On Top of the Peak”
: Another boastful lyric on another killer rhythm,
a horn version of Eric Donaldson's “Lonely
Nights.” Produced by Alvin “GG” Ranglin.

“Dynamic Fashion Way”
: After name checking saxophonist Val Bennett and
“the great producer K[eith] Hudson,” U-Roy observes
“studio kinda real cloudy like I say” before informing
the listener that this is the *third* version of “Old
Fashion Way.” Strange, because this is reportedly
the first ever deejay record. So what is the *second*
version of “Old Fashion Way”? And while we can clearly
hear elements of the Ken Boothe original, Hudson
overdubbed a new bass line before voicing the deejay.
So the purist might complain that that disqualifies it
from being truly a deejay/version record.

“Hard Feeling”
: There's a really innovative drum pattern opening this
record. I had this for some time before I realized it's
a version of Paul Simon's “Cecilia.”


“The Higher the Mountain”
: A version of Errol Dunkley's “Baby I Love You” and a
contender for best U-Roy record ever, introduced by a
classic deejay lyric:
<span class="lyrics">
“The higher the mountain
The cooler the breeze
The warmer the couple (as I would tell it you, good gosh!)
The tighter the squeeze”
</span>

“You Keep On Running”
: This is credited to Delroy and U-Roy on the label.
“Delroy” is Delroy Wilson. I've seen Coxsone Dodd
miscredited as the producer but he was not involved,
nor is this a version of Wilson's “Run Run,” which
Dodd *did* produce.

“Joyful Locks”
: A celebratory outing on Linval Thompson's rasta anthem
“Don't Cut Off Your Dreadlocks.” U-Roy incorporates
Psalm 68 into his lyrics. Produced by Bunny Lee.

“Jump For Joy”
: Another Bunny Lee production. The intro has a
wonderfully echoed excerpt of Johnny Clarke, over
which U-Roy exclaims, “shake your festival.” Was this
intended for Jamaica's annual song festival contest?

“Festival Wise”
: U-Roy expertly rides Eric Donaldson's “Blue Boot” for
perhaps another festival song entry? Donaldson's lyrics
are inscrutable, so it's hard to say.

“Wet Vision”
: A fantastic cut produced by Bunny Lee, using a synthesizer
version of Max Romeo's ribald “Wet Dream.” This record is
also known as “Wet Version.” Romeo's original was a hit
record despite (or because) it was banned for suggestive
lyrics.



“Rightful Ruler”
: Ok, this *was* included in the “Here and Now” piece, but
I'm adding it to this list anyways because it's such a great
cut. “Rightful Ruler” is a 1969 collaboration with Peter
Tosh, who introduces the record with a prayer in Amharic
and English. Then U-Roy takes over, reading from
Psalm 1
while Tosh shouts “Jah! Rastafari!” in the background.
The music includes a brief acoustic excerpt spliced with
a version of the Reggae Boys' “Selassie.”
It's an unusual record for any artist in the late 60s,
certainly for U-Roy, whose early lyrics were mostly
dancehall inspired boasts and chats.



“Love I Tender”
: From the Duke Reid organization, and specifically Byron
Smith, Reid's sound engineer and the producer for this cut.
The rhythm track is the Ethiopians' “Mother's Tender Care.”
On the intro, U-Roy shouts, “wow wee papa girl!”
I've always wondered if that lyric inspired the name
for hip-hop/raggamuffin/dancehall artists Wee Papa Girls.
[Wikipedia says their name comes from the French expression <i lang="fr">oui papa</i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wee_Papa_Girl_Rappers),
but
